What's up! My name is Minh and currently reside in the bay area.

I graduated from UCLA in 2012 with a degree in Biology and the majority of my work experience has been in molecular biology (3+ years as a Scientist at Roche). Additionally, the past 2 years I have been involved with NBA data and statistics, from 2 seasons with the Warriors' D-League (now known as the G-League) affiliate team as a Statistician and a credentialed Scout at Golden State Warrior home games for the 2016-2017 season and continuing onto this current 2017-2018 season. It's cool to see how data and high performance computing (specifically GPUs) has influenced pretty much every field, especially in the fields I've been particularly involved in (science and sports). My constant curiosity for technology and figuring out how things work has led me to become a self taught programmer (thanks to the internet). When I'm not googling error messages, I'm usually watching basketball, snowboarding, or working on my car (2017 Subaru WRX).

Things that get me excited: GPUs, machine learning, OSINT, cryptocurrency, boxer engines, and of course basketball.
